Here are some promising additions that I think would make my porfolio site much more clean and comprehensive:

- Projects page and Others page: As you can see, it is a blank page that's I've attempted to create some sort of template using CSS grid from last assignment. By using CRUD, it would be much more intuitive to put data into the page instead of hardcode it into the HTML file & hardcode the CSS grid & format. Which keeps everything clean and less tangled.

- ATTEMPTED FOR PART 5: Applied DOMPurify Contact page to prevent malicious attack. I was not able to figure out why DOMPurify does not work on this page, so I think I'll spend more time to look into it in the future. Maybe it needs some event listeners.
