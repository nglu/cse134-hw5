            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>I am a person who is enthusiastic about human interactions and how we can work together to make a better 
                impact on our communities, locally and hopefully globally. Currently, I am studying Computer Science 
                at UC San Diego, one of the best public colleges in the U.S. (and has the nicest beaches in California). </p>
            <p>I lived in Viet Nam for 20 years before I moved to the U.S. and it is very interesting to see the differences
                in every aspects of life between here and my home country. With my background, I hope that I can bring a new 
                perspective in creating products that understand and represent cultural diversity so that we can all work 
                towards a common goal without getting hinder by complicated tools and medium.</p>

            <p>I believe in empathy. I want to believe that good things exist in life despite all the negatives that have 
                been spiralling down recently. Even if the world is not a nice place to live right now, I want to have the

            <p>Good things take time. I am still practicing my craft and learning through classes and personal projects. 
                I don't know what I don't know, but I make a pledge to myself that I will try my best to pursue knowledge. 
                One step at a time I will be able to identify the things that I don't know, and ultimately, I will understand 
                them and they will become my personal assets.</p>
